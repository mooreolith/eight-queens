by Joshua Moore, January 19th, 2025

[This](https://mooreolith.github.io/eight-queens) eight queens riddle challenges you to place eight queens on a chess board so that they cannot threaten each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. A band of text at the bottom records what you've clicked in chess notation, if you complete the riddle, you get a checkmark. That's it.

This is a rewrite of [eight-queens-old](https://github.com/mooreolith/eight-queens-old).
